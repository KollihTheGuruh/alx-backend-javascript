# 0x03-ES6_data_manipulation

## Task 0: Basic list of objects

### File: 0-get_list_students.js

* Create a function named getListStudents that returns an array of objects.
* Each object should have three attributes: id (Number), firstName (String), and location (String).
* The array contains the following students in order:
* - Guillaume, id: 1, in San Francisco
* - James, id: 2, in Columbia
* - Serena, id: 5, in San Francisco

## Task 1: More mapping

### File: 1-get_list_student_ids.js

* Create a function getListStudentIds that returns an array of ids from a list of object.
* This function takes one argument, which is an array of objects, in the same format as getListStudents from the previous task.
* If the argument is not an array, the function returns an empty array.
* You must use the map function on the array.

## Task 2: Filter

### File: 2-get_students_by_loc.js

* Create a function getStudentsByLocation that returns an array of objects who are located in a specific city.
* It should accept a list of students (from getListStudents) and a city (string) as parameters.
* You must use the filter function on the array.

## Task 3: Reduce

### File: 3-get_ids_sum.js

* Create a function getStudentIdsSum that returns the sum of all the student ids.
* It should accept a list of students (from getListStudents) as a parameter.
* You must use the reduce function on the array.

## Task 4: Combine

### File: 4-update_grade_by_city.js

* Create a function updateStudentGradeByCity that returns an array of students for a specific city with their new grade.
* It should accept a list of students (from getListStudents), a city (String), and newGrades (Array of “grade” objects) as parameters.
* newGrades is an array of objects with this format:
* { studentId: 31, grade: 78 }
* If a student doesn’t have a grade in newGrades, the final grade should be N/A.
* You must use filter and map combined.

## Task 5: Typed Arrays

### File: 5-typed_arrays.js

* Create a function named createInt8TypedArray that returns a new ArrayBuffer with an Int8 value at a specific position.
* It should accept three arguments: length (Number), position (Number), and value (Number).
* If adding the value is not possible, the error "Position outside range" should be thrown.

## Task 6: Set data structure

### File: 6-set.js

* Create a function named setFromArray that returns a Set from an array.
* It accepts an argument (Array, of any kind of element).

## Task 7: More set data structure

### File: 7-has_array_values.js

* Create a function named hasValuesFromArray that returns a boolean if all the elements in the array exist within the set.
* It accepts two arguments: a set (Set) and an array (Array).

## Task 8: Clean set

### File: 8-clean_set.js

* Create a function named cleanSet that returns a string of all the set values that start with a specific string (startString).
* It accepts two arguments: a set (Set) and a startString (String).
* When a value starts with startString, append the rest of the string. The string contains all the values of the set separated by -.

## Task 9: Map data structure

### File: 9-groceries_list.js

* Create a function named groceriesList that returns a map of groceries with the following items (name, quantity):
* - Apples, 10
* - Tomatoes, 10
* - Pasta, 1
* - Rice, 1
* - Banana, 5

## Task 10: More map data structure

### File: 10-update_uniq_items.js

* Create a function named updateUniqueItems that returns an updated map for all items with an initial quantity of 1.
* It should accept a map as an argument, similar to the map created in the previous task.
* For each entry of the map where the quantity is 1, update the quantity to 100.
* If updating the quantity is not possible (argument is not a map), the error "Cannot process" should be thrown.

## Task 11: Weak link data structure

### File: 100-weak.js

* Export a const instance of WeakMap and name it weakMap.
* Export a new function named queryAPI. It should accept an endpoint argument like so:
* { protocol: 'http', name: 'getUsers' }
* Track within the weakMap the number of times queryAPI is called for each endpoint.
* When the number of queries is >= 5, throw an error with the message "Endpoint load is high".
